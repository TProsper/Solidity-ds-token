ds-token
===

An opinionated token building block. It extends ERC20 with `auth`enticated `mint` (create), `burn` (destroy), and `freeze` (disable erc20 functions).

The old "ds-token" repository was an example of using frontend/controller/datastore contracts for upgradeability. This can be found at [`ds-token-system`](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-token-system).
