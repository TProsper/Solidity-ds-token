ds-token
===

Expect turbulence as this package is extracted from `dappsys`.

Token implementation using frontend/controller/datastore contracts for upgradeability.

The factory installs "into" a `DSBasicAuthority` (see `ds-auth`).

If this is overkill for your dapp and overriding a single-contract implementation is sufficient, consider `nexusdev/erc20`.
